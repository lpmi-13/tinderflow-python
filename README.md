this is a demo of using nltk, flask, and angular to get a glimpse into
what a machine learning model might see as it's learning to classify
things.

*this currently only runs in python2*

after installing (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), you'll also need to
download the nltk data:

```
$ import nltk
$ nltk.downloader('all')
```

then

```
$ python2 app.py
```
