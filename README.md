infinitives and feeding those errant sentences into your production
line!

If you spot a problem STOP THE LINE, fix the problem, and resume
production. Think of the children that will read your beautiful
sentences and the sublime joy they will experience.

`Sentence Factory` is a game where the user needs to ensure
that no malformed sentences make it through the production line.
                                   
When they find a problem, the user needs to stop the line and fix
the issue. This could be as simple as identifying a missing apostrophe,
or even changing the form of a verb to the correct tense.

As the levels progress, the speed of the sentences increases and the
vocabulary level could also increase as well.
